During the height of the pandemic last year, I moved home to Malaysia to be with family and this brought about a massive change to my routine, independent freedoms and way of living. \n \nPole dancing and exploring sensuality has increasingly become a passion of mine, but under a strict Chinese household in Malaysia, this felt really restricted. I noticed that I hid away my authentic self in front of the watchful eye of my family, and that ultimately affected my confidence. During the lockdown, I felt so isolated, like so many of us did, without the ability to socialise or do what I love; dance in a studio. However, during this time and almost completely by accident, I found a new hobby and a new community online that brought me so much joy, and still does to this day. \n \nI started drawing pole dancers as a way to still connect to the aerial and pole community while I was stuck at home. I really enjoyed capturing these poses with minimalistic line art, but I started to add floral elements to inject some of my taste and personality into the pieces. As a dancer, I really love movement...and soon enough I started to try my hand at animation. I have had the most amazing time combining my interest in body inclusivity and movement with art, and through it I regained happiness and confidence within myself, using my Instagram account as my creative outlet.\n \nWith my art I try to create a welcoming and warm space. I love interacting with so many like-minded creatives. I have had the amazing opportunity to connect with some of my favourite artists and brands such as SoyandSpice Lingerie (Australia) and OurBraletteClub (Singapore) and JyGao (Canada). One of the highlights of my year was collaborating with my friend, and pole dancer, Callum Stevens to fundraise for a non-profit organization in Malaysia called SEED who were working hard to support Trans people affected by the pandemic in Malaysia by providing food and groceries, shelter and access to emergency and medical services. We ended up raising RM3186 (approximately £556) for their Trans Solidarity Fund, which completely exceeded our hopes and expectations.  \n \nI have been incredibly lucky in my art journey and I am surrounded by inspiration and amazing friends. I started from making drawings of my friends, to animation, and now I have even started a venture with a partner to make ornaments and acrylic lights. I never would have imagined that this account would bring me such opportunities, and I am forever grateful. Throughout the changes in my life, something that has remained constant is my desire to stay true to myself and express that creatively in any capacity I can. \n \nZoe Hooper\n@x_she.doodles_x\n"},{"id":1642550400,"title":"“The university experience”","author":"Tanishtha Goswami (she/her)","date":"January 19, 2022","coverurl":"./assets/images/uni-exp.png","content":"TW: Sexual Assault\n\nWhat defines the university experience? For me the university experience is rushing through campus to get to my class that started ten minutes ago while shamefully holding a fresh coffee and thereby getting possibly the worst seat for the next two hours of my life. I think the concept of “the university experience” probably differs person to person, I’m sure to some, it's the parties or clubbing or sports games or other tropes that you see in every coming-of-age movie ever.  It would have never once crossed my mind that these “experiences” that are so intertwined with the idea of university or college could ever be something so brutally honest and to be frank, sad. \n \nI don’t remember exactly where I was when I saw the sign for the first time, but I do remember that I was walking through Potterrow when it caught my eye. I couldn’t have lingered on it for more than a second, but the words haunted my mind the entire day. \n \n                        “Sexual assault should NOT be a part of your college experience” \n \nIt wasn’t until then that I realized how much I normalised sexual assault in this day and age - especially within university culture. I thought back to the countless discussions I had with my friends where we shared our collective “creepy” experiences in clubs, parties, or even just walking home in broad daylight. How I brushed it off and continued with my life because it was simply just another part of us. How when the use of spiking in clubs suddenly became another mental note to ‘carry a jacket’ and ‘be extra cautious’ when trying to have a fun time with your friends. I wasn’t sure when I decided to be so apathetic - though it wasn’t a conscious choice on my part. \n \nIt made me realize how much I was contributing to this normalisation culture. How every time I heard another story or an encounter, I simply brushed it off as if it was a daily occurrence. How I suddenly stopped caring about protests and petitions because so often I felt that nothing ever changed. How I repeatedly told myself that any type of uncomfortableness was simply ‘part of being a woman’. \n \nIt made me disgusted with myself, but I still couldn’t shake my feeling of indifference. It was reassuring to know that even though I was being passive that there were still people out there who cared now more than ever. It was a wakeup call of sorts. It’s so easy to reach this point where you suddenly detach from how terrible everything really is. Take the pandemic as an example, I remember how alert and cautious everyone was when the first wave took place. Now? Many people can’t find the energy within them to still be as concerned or responsive about it. \n \nSometimes a wake-up call is exactly what you need. Even though there is nothing I want to do more right now than pretend that sexual assault isn’t a problem that plagues our society, I know I can’t. I can’t pretend to write about something else to not face reality.  I hope this can serve as a wake-up call for you too. I also hope that it is equally reassuring that it is okay to feel disheartened when fighting against these issues, but that when you do choose to come back you will be welcomed with open arms. \n"},{"id":1642550400,"title":"Rachel Gladwin Message From World Interview Transcription","author":"Moira Semel","date":"January 19, 2022","coverurl":"./assets/images/rachel-interview.png","content":"\nInterview by Moira Semel\n\n**How would you describe _Message from World_?**\n\n_Message from World_ is an instagram account with pictures of street signs, graffiti, advertisements, just anything where it’s a piece of text I’m seeing out in the world that I didn’t expect to see, that I don’t know who wrote it. I take a picture of it and I put it on the instagram. \n\n**How did this instagram account start?**\n\nIt started when I was interrailing. I had been taking a lot of photos of texts when I was traveling because I’m very drawn to when there's a weird sticker or just like someone's written something funny. There was this huge billboard outside the airport when I was going home, I was flying by myself for the first time so I was anxious and it just said _comfort _on it. And I thought _that’s fun_ ‘cause it’s like a message from the universe being like chill out. I just impulsively decided to start the account because it was the kind of thing that you don’t actually want to fill up your instagram feed with just pictures of words so it's just a fun little thing where I just put them up there.\n\n**What do you imagine other people get out of looking at _Message from World?_**\n\nI think it satisfies the same curiosity of when you’re out on the street and you see something weird that someone has written. It's fun. And it’s funny when you’re walking down the street and someone points out a sign that is like _that’s weird. _It’s more interesting sometimes than looking at an image to read some words. It’s stimulating and it’s interesting. And then also some of my friends who follow the account will send them to me when they see one and it becomes like a collaborative thing. So I wonder if it makes people notice more. I think anything where you’re just noticing more things makes life a bit more interesting. To read those words and give value to them by taking a photo. \n\n**So, how do you think noticing small messages from the universe changes your daily life?**\n\nIt means that I’m always reading things and I’m always thinking, _is that an interesting message? _I pay more attention to graffiti and advertisements and stuff. I actually really enjoy the less organic ones where it’s just a weird advert with a weird slogan and I’m like _if you take that out of context of the advert it’s a weird sentence _and I think that’s quite fun. \n\n**When you take pictures are you thinking of how the followers might view it or are you thinking about your own interpretation?**\n\nI’m kind of thinking about both. I don’t love taking pictures of something that’s very obvious, like if it’s already an interesting piece of artwork with something written out with the intention of being a beautiful message– I do have some like that on there–  but I’m less interested in that. I think it’s more interesting when I’m recontextualizing something that’s just a bit random and no one intended it to be that meaningful. So I don’t know if anyone who follows me cares but I don’t want to go too cheesy. \n\n**Do you see the messages as from the universe or are the viewers the ones who make it a message?**\n\nI like buying into the idea of that. That’s like the bit of the account, pretending that I’m seeing these messages because the universe is sending them to me but they’re obviously just random things and I am constructing meaning from them and whoever is looking at the account is constructing meaning from them. It’s having a good sense of what things could mean, having good humour about it, is what gives it meaning. I don’t actually think the universe is talking to me, it's just a fun game. \n\n**What is your favorite message on the account?**\n\nI like this one where it's a street sign and it says _take extra care. _It’s saying don’t fall into the canal but out of context it’s kind of beautiful. \n\n_See the light, repairs. _That’s another good one. Like _See the light!. _Yeah, haha. Those are some favorites where it’s very obviously not a meaningful thing but taken out of context.\n\n**If you had one thing to say to the reader about _Message from World_, what would you tell them?**\n\nI would tell them to follow it and to start taking photos of any phrases they think are interesting and send them to me. ‘Cause it’s a fun game. Like just walk around and pretend that everything you read could be so interesting. Like adverts, so boring and horrible and pushed on us, but it’s fun to take them out of context. Take some photos and send them to me. :)\n\n**Rachel Gladwin (she/her) is the admin of the instagram account @messagefromworld and a student at the University of Edinburgh.  ** "}]

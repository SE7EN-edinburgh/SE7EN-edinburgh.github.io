Se7en Magazine was created to represent women across the University of Edinburgh and beyond.

Our aim is to highlight various aspects of women’s experiences across all areas of the University, and to foster an inclusive and diverse atmosphere to share opinions, ideas and creativity.

The Edinburgh Seven were the first group of matriculated female undergraduate students at a University in Britain, who campaigned and fought for the right of women to a university education. While these 7 medical students began studying at Edinburgh in 1869, they were not officially recognized as graduates and posthumously presented with their degrees until 2019.

Se7en Magazine has been named after these pioneers of women’s education to honour their legacy of women students at the University of Edinburgh.

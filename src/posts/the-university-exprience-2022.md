TW: Sexual Assault

What defines the university experience? For me the university experience is rushing through campus to get to my class that started ten minutes ago while shamefully holding a fresh coffee and thereby getting possibly the worst seat for the next two hours of my life. I think the concept of “the university experience” probably differs person to person, I’m sure to some, it's the parties or clubbing or sports games or other tropes that you see in every coming-of-age movie ever.  It would have never once crossed my mind that these “experiences” that are so intertwined with the idea of university or college could ever be something so brutally honest and to be frank, sad. 
 
I don’t remember exactly where I was when I saw the sign for the first time, but I do remember that I was walking through Potterrow when it caught my eye. I couldn’t have lingered on it for more than a second, but the words haunted my mind the entire day. 
 
                        “Sexual assault should NOT be a part of your college experience” 
 
It wasn’t until then that I realized how much I normalised sexual assault in this day and age - especially within university culture. I thought back to the countless discussions I had with my friends where we shared our collective “creepy” experiences in clubs, parties, or even just walking home in broad daylight. How I brushed it off and continued with my life because it was simply just another part of us. How when the use of spiking in clubs suddenly became another mental note to ‘carry a jacket’ and ‘be extra cautious’ when trying to have a fun time with your friends. I wasn’t sure when I decided to be so apathetic - though it wasn’t a conscious choice on my part. 
 
It made me realize how much I was contributing to this normalisation culture. How every time I heard another story or an encounter, I simply brushed it off as if it was a daily occurrence. How I suddenly stopped caring about protests and petitions because so often I felt that nothing ever changed. How I repeatedly told myself that any type of uncomfortableness was simply ‘part of being a woman’. 
 
It made me disgusted with myself, but I still couldn’t shake my feeling of indifference. It was reassuring to know that even though I was being passive that there were still people out there who cared now more than ever. It was a wakeup call of sorts. It’s so easy to reach this point where you suddenly detach from how terrible everything really is. Take the pandemic as an example, I remember how alert and cautious everyone was when the first wave took place. Now? Many people can’t find the energy within them to still be as concerned or responsive about it. 
 
Sometimes a wake-up call is exactly what you need. Even though there is nothing I want to do more right now than pretend that sexual assault isn’t a problem that plagues our society, I know I can’t. I can’t pretend to write about something else to not face reality.  I hope this can serve as a wake-up call for you too. I also hope that it is equally reassuring that it is okay to feel disheartened when fighting against these issues, but that when you do choose to come back you will be welcomed with open arms.

Interview by Moira Semel

**How would you describe _Message from World_?**

_Message from World_ is an instagram account with pictures of street signs, graffiti, advertisements, just anything where it’s a piece of text I’m seeing out in the world that I didn’t expect to see, that I don’t know who wrote it. I take a picture of it and I put it on the instagram. 

**How did this instagram account start?**

It started when I was interrailing. I had been taking a lot of photos of texts when I was traveling because I’m very drawn to when there's a weird sticker or just like someone's written something funny. There was this huge billboard outside the airport when I was going home, I was flying by myself for the first time so I was anxious and it just said _comfort _on it. And I thought _that’s fun_ ‘cause it’s like a message from the universe being like chill out. I just impulsively decided to start the account because it was the kind of thing that you don’t actually want to fill up your instagram feed with just pictures of words so it's just a fun little thing where I just put them up there.

**What do you imagine other people get out of looking at _Message from World?_**

I think it satisfies the same curiosity of when you’re out on the street and you see something weird that someone has written. It's fun. And it’s funny when you’re walking down the street and someone points out a sign that is like _that’s weird. _It’s more interesting sometimes than looking at an image to read some words. It’s stimulating and it’s interesting. And then also some of my friends who follow the account will send them to me when they see one and it becomes like a collaborative thing. So I wonder if it makes people notice more. I think anything where you’re just noticing more things makes life a bit more interesting. To read those words and give value to them by taking a photo. 

**So, how do you think noticing small messages from the universe changes your daily life?**

It means that I’m always reading things and I’m always thinking, _is that an interesting message? _I pay more attention to graffiti and advertisements and stuff. I actually really enjoy the less organic ones where it’s just a weird advert with a weird slogan and I’m like _if you take that out of context of the advert it’s a weird sentence _and I think that’s quite fun. 

**When you take pictures are you thinking of how the followers might view it or are you thinking about your own interpretation?**

I’m kind of thinking about both. I don’t love taking pictures of something that’s very obvious, like if it’s already an interesting piece of artwork with something written out with the intention of being a beautiful message– I do have some like that on there–  but I’m less interested in that. I think it’s more interesting when I’m recontextualizing something that’s just a bit random and no one intended it to be that meaningful. So I don’t know if anyone who follows me cares but I don’t want to go too cheesy. 

**Do you see the messages as from the universe or are the viewers the ones who make it a message?**

I like buying into the idea of that. That’s like the bit of the account, pretending that I’m seeing these messages because the universe is sending them to me but they’re obviously just random things and I am constructing meaning from them and whoever is looking at the account is constructing meaning from them. It’s having a good sense of what things could mean, having good humour about it, is what gives it meaning. I don’t actually think the universe is talking to me, it's just a fun game. 

**What is your favorite message on the account?**

I like this one where it's a street sign and it says _take extra care. _It’s saying don’t fall into the canal but out of context it’s kind of beautiful. 

_See the light, repairs. _That’s another good one. Like _See the light!. _Yeah, haha. Those are some favorites where it’s very obviously not a meaningful thing but taken out of context.

**If you had one thing to say to the reader about _Message from World_, what would you tell them?**

I would tell them to follow it and to start taking photos of any phrases they think are interesting and send them to me. ‘Cause it’s a fun game. Like just walk around and pretend that everything you read could be so interesting. Like adverts, so boring and horrible and pushed on us, but it’s fun to take them out of context. Take some photos and send them to me. :)
